# Motivation

## What is this guide?

A set of practical guidelines for building React apps such that they're maximally reactive, predictable, and maintainable.

## What are our problems?

- Long, complicated components
- Complex webs of state that interact in unpredictable ways
- Difficulty in extending existing components -- it's hard to do our jobs!
  - Small changes have the potential to create infinite loops
  - Changing state fields often results in unpredictable chains of effects
  - It's often difficult to see the 'right' way to do things, resulting in understandable 'hacks'
- We're in a situation where, given any particular task, the easiest thing to do just adds to our existing set of problems!

## Common Code Smells

A "code smell" is a simple hint that strongly indicates at an issue in your code.
I'll try to address _why_ these are code smells, and what alternatives to consider, later in this doc.

1. useEffect being used to set state
   1. this might be the most controversial (but also the most important), as code doing exactly this forms a large proportion of our Configurations code
1. Ignored dependencies in hooks (most often useEffect)
1. Refs used to get around ignored dependencies
1. Comments referencing the lifecycle of the component, like: `// this should just be called once on mount!`

## How can we improve?

### Reactivity?

It's in the name! Components should _react_ to changes in a predictable way.
When the relevant data changes, what's rendered should change! (I know this sounds obvious!)

We all know the mental model: React components are essentially just functions: `f(props) => rendered result`

```jsx live
function Sum({ a, b }) {
  return (
    <p>
      Let's add! {a} + {b} = {a + b}
    </p>
  );
}

render(<Sum a={1} b={2} />);
```

State complicates this, but not by much.
Props and state are still just values that can be used to render a result!

```jsx live
function getIntFromEvent(e) {
  const num = parseInt(e.target.value);
  return Number.isInteger(num) ? num : null;
}

function Sum() {
  const [a, setA] = useState(1);
  const [b, setB] = useState(2);
  return (
    <div>
      <p>
        Let's add! {a} + {b} = {a + b}
      </p>
      <div>
        A: <input value={a} onChange={(e) => setA(getIntFromEvent(e))} />
      </div>
      <div>
        B: <input value={b} onChange={(e) => setB(getIntFromEvent(e))} />
      </div>
    </div>
  );
}

render(<Sum />);
```

### What about side effects?

The primary purpose of useEffect is to manage 'side effects':

- Fetching data from an API
- Managing asynchronous tasks (`setTimeout`, `setInterval`)
- Managing external objects with their own lifecycle (`IntersectionObserver`, external libraries)

```jsx live
function Timer() {
  const [secondsPassed, setSecondsPassed] = useState(0);

  useEffect(() => {
    function tick() {
      setSecondsPassed((s) => s + 1);
    }
    const timer = setInterval(tick, 1000);
    return () => clearInterval(timer);
  }, []);

  return <h3>Seconds passed: {secondsPassed}</h3>;
}

render(<Timer />);
```

However, our most common use of useEffect is an **anti-pattern**: synchronizing state fields with other state fields.
