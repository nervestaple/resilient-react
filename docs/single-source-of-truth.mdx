# Single Source of Truth

If an app contains data, that data should be _minimally represented_.

Put another way, every 'unique' piece of data should have exactly one place it's stored and updated.
All downstream uses of that data should be passed down, transformed into derived values, but never duplicated in another state field.

_(note: this doesn't mean you're not allowed to store 'working copies' of user-editable data in state fields)_

## Minimally represented?

This doesn't necessarily mean we need to just mindlessly combine state fields into compound objects (though often that's the right choice).
Primarily, the goal is to identify and eliminate situations where data stored in state essentially duplicates data stored in other state, even if in a transformed form.

Consider this example:

```jsx live
function TextTransformer() {
  const [text, setText] = useState("Test");
  const [capitalizedText, setCapitalizedText] = useState(text.toUpperCase());
  const [isCaps, setIsCaps] = useState(false);

  return (
    <div>
      <input
        value={text}
        onChange={(e) => {
          setText(e.target.value);
          setCapitalizedText(e.target.value.toUpperCase());
        }}
      />{" "}
      Capitalize?{" "}
      <input
        type="checkbox"
        onChange={() => setIsCaps((c) => !c)}
        checked={isCaps}
      />
      <hr />
      <h3>{isCaps ? capitalizedText : text}</h3>
    </div>
  );
}
render(<TextTransformer />);
```

The issue with this example (duplicated representations of data across multiple state fields) might be obvious --
but even then, it seems relatively harmless.
After all -- it works! What's the big deal?

## "The Bug"

Unfortunately, the decision made to represent the app's state in this way is insidious,
and its implications might not become apparent until later on in development.

```jsx live
function TextTransformer() {
  const [text, setText] = useState("Test");
  const [capitalizedText, setCapitalizedText] = useState(text.toUpperCase());
  const [isCaps, setIsCaps] = useState(false);

  return (
    <div style={{ display: "flex", flexDirection: "column" }}>
      <input
        value={text}
        onChange={(e) => {
          setText(e.target.value);
          setCapitalizedText(e.target.value.toUpperCase());
        }}
      />
      <label>
        Capitalize?{" "}
        <input
          type="checkbox"
          onChange={() => setIsCaps((c) => !c)}
          checked={isCaps}
        />
      </label>
      <button onClick={() => setText("")}>Reset</button>
      <hr />
      <h3>{isCaps ? capitalizedText : text}</h3>
    </div>
  );
}
render(<TextTransformer />);
```

The bug is a bit contrived (forgetting to resetting `capitalizedText` in the reset button), but it represents a real threat to our code.
Once data becomes duplicated in this way, it becomes much harder to keep track of all the ways we need to change it.

## Looking at Two Fixes: Bad and Worse

Let's put aside the best way to fix this issue. What are some common ways developers will choose to fix this?

### BAD:

```jsx
<button
  onClick={() => {
    setText("");
    setCapitalizedText("");
  }}
>
  Reset
</button>
```

This fixes the issue. The state is back in sync. But -- whenever this logic is modified or extended in the future,
we still have to keep track and synchronize these two state fields.

### WORSE:

But, with long components and complex webs of state and business logic,
it can feel easy to reach `useEffect` as a way to "cut through the BS":

```jsx live
function TextTransformer() {
  const [text, setText] = useState("Test");
  const [capitalizedText, setCapitalizedText] = useState(text.toUpperCase());
  const [isCaps, setIsCaps] = useState(false);

  useEffect(() => {
    setCapitalizedText(text.toUpperCase());
  }, [text]);

  return (
    <div style={{ display: "flex", flexDirection: "column" }}>
      <input
        value={text}
        onChange={(e) => {
          setText(e.target.value);
          setCapitalizedText(e.target.value.toUpperCase());
        }}
      />
      <label>
        Capitalize?{" "}
        <input
          type="checkbox"
          onChange={() => setIsCaps((c) => !c)}
          checked={isCaps}
        />
      </label>
      <button onClick={() => setText("")}>Reset</button>
      <hr />
      <h3>{isCaps ? capitalizedText : text}</h3>
    </div>
  );
}
render(<TextTransformer />);
```

This also fixes it, but at the cost of extra renders -- and, more importantly,
adding unpredictable side-effects to changing state. In this example, it becomes much more difficult to reason about
exactly what the state of `text` and `capitalizedText` is during each render. Now -- imagine 10 more state fields,
each with their own `useEffects` synchronizing them to each other.

### BEST!

Hopefully I've demonstrated that 'working' code is not necessarily correct or advisable.
The 'code smell' present in the previous example -- of `setState` inside `useEffect` --
can lead us in the direction of optimal code.

Let's ask, for real:

> "Take all the data needed to render this application.
> What is the least amount of state we can use to represent this data?"

The main realization necessary is that `capitalizedText` is just duplicated state.
In every render, it can be entirely derived from the current state of `text`.
We don't need the extra state field, nor the effect required to synchronize it.

```jsx live
function TextTransformer() {
  const [text, setText] = useState("Test");
  const [isCaps, setIsCaps] = useState(false);

  const capitalizedText = text.toUpperCase();

  return (
    <div style={{ display: "flex", flexDirection: "column" }}>
      <input value={text} onChange={(e) => setText(e.target.value)} />
      <label>
        Capitalize?{" "}
        <input
          type="checkbox"
          onChange={() => setIsCaps((c) => !c)}
          checked={isCaps}
        />
      </label>
      <button onClick={() => setText("")}>Reset</button>
      <hr />
      <h3>{isCaps ? capitalizedText : text}</h3>
    </div>
  );
}
render(<TextTransformer />);
```

The solution for 'derived state' -- state that can be entirely derived from other available data --
is `const`! Just assign a variable that's calculated on every render. In this simple example, we could even have just
put `text.toUpperCase()` inline in the JSX.

Like I said, this is a contrived example,
but it represents a simplified version of a lot of the problems facing our codebase!

Imagine growing the original example with derived state into a much more complex app. Once `capitalizedText` is introduced,
and our application becomes more dependent on it, it might be hard to imagine removing it.
After all, all this code -- states, useEffects, etc, is "doing important stuff"!
It becomes difficult to remove any single piece of it without breaking a complex web of
state, effects, and synchronized state.
