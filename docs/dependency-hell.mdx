# Dependency Hell

## Our enemies

Our codebase is under threat. Our enemies are hiding, lying in wait everywhere. They must be destroyed:

```jsx
useEffect(() => {
  /* ... code code code ... */
  // eslint-disable-next-line react-hooks/exhaustive-deps
}, []);
// This effect should just run on mount!!! Don't add any dependencies!
```

```jsx
useEffect(() => {
  doSomethingWith(thingA, thingB);
  // eslint-disable-next-line react-hooks/exhaustive-deps
}, [thingA]);
```

```jsx
const myValue = useRef("something");
useEffect(() => {
  doSomethingWith(myValue.current);
}, []);
```

## Why can't I just ignore deps if it feels necessary? Why are you being so annoying?!

Ok, ok. Imagine we're fetching data from an API:

```jsx live
async function mockFetchNotes(apiKey) {
  return new Promise((resolve) =>
    setTimeout(
      () =>
        resolve([
          { id: 1, text: "buy shoes" },
          { id: 2, text: "eat food" },
        ]),
      500
    )
  );
}

function useFakeContext() {
  return "api-key";
}

function NoteList() {
  const apiKey = useFakeContext();
  const [notes, setNotes] = useState(null);

  useEffect(() => {
    async function fetchNotes() {
      const n = await mockFetchNotes(apiKey);
      setNotes(n);
    }
    fetchNotes();
    // eslint-disable-next-line react-hooks/exhaustive-deps
  }, []);

  if (!notes) {
    return "Loading...";
  }

  return (
    <ul>
      {notes.map((n) => (
        <li key={n.id}>{n.text}</li>
      ))}
    </ul>
  );
}

render(
  <ComponentWithRefresh>
    <NoteList />
  </ComponentWithRefresh>
);
```

It's a simple, familiar situation. We need to display a list of notes.
Those notes originate from an API. Fetching that data is a 'side effect', so we do it inside
`useEffect`.

Whoever wrote this probably thought:
_"Fetching data should be done on mount, so the useEffect dependency array should be `[]`.
The linter complains about this, so we just need to tell it to shut up."_

### Opening your third eye: thinking beyond "render ordering"

Unfortunately, thinking about 'when we're mounted' and 'which render we're on' has already trapped us in the wrong mental model.
A better mental model is treating renders as fully independent calls of the component function, unrelated to 'mounting' or other lifecycle events.
Each render has data (from state and props) that's in scope, that you transform and use to generate a render result.
There were (probably) renders before this one, and there will (probably) be renders after.
The best part -- it doesn't really matter as long as we generally treat renders as independent, repeatable events that can happen at any time.

In general, React always runs effects after each render, then optimizes by skipping certain effects if it deems it necessary.
In fact, in "StrictMode", React intentionally runs all effects twice!
If your effects can't safely be run twice, your code will be brittle!

Ensuring effects run -- whenever necessary and with current versions of their dependent data -- is _much more_ important than trying to control _how often_ effects will run.

### When dependencies change but effects aren't run

Let's return to the above example. Imagine somewhere else in the app, a dropdown is changed -- `apiKey` is switched from a test key to a production key.
Already, our assumption that 'this needs to run once, on mount' has been broken. Our component will not _react_ to this change.

Additionally, our `eslint-ignore` statement is also hurting any future developers who work on this code --
preventing them from being notified if they extend this code and add more implicit dependencies!

```jsx live
const apiData = [
  { id: 1, text: "buy shoes" },
  { id: 2, text: "eat food", isImportant: true },
];

async function mockFetchNotes(apiKey, onlyImportant) {
  return new Promise((resolve) =>
    setTimeout(() => {
      if (onlyImportant) {
        resolve(apiData.filter((n) => n.isImportant));
      } else {
        resolve(apiData);
      }
    }, 500)
  );
}

function useFakeContext() {
  return "api-key";
}

function NoteList() {
  const apiKey = useFakeContext();
  const [notes, setNotes] = useState(null);
  const [onlyImportant, setOnlyImportant] = useState(false);

  useEffect(() => {
    async function fetchNotes() {
      const n = await mockFetchNotes(apiKey, onlyImportant);
      setNotes(n);
    }
    fetchNotes();
    // eslint-disable-next-line react-hooks/exhaustive-deps
  }, []);

  return (
    <>
      {notes && (
        <ul>
          {notes.map((n) => (
            <li key={n.id}>{n.text}</li>
          ))}
        </ul>
      )}
      <div>
        Important notes only:{" "}
        <input
          type="checkbox"
          checked={onlyImportant}
          onChange={() => setOnlyImportant((i) => !i)}
        />
      </div>
    </>
  );
}

render(
  <ComponentWithRefresh>
    <NoteList />
  </ComponentWithRefresh>
);
```

It obviously doesn't work. When `isImportant` changes, the effect is not re-run, and the data is stale.
_(of course, we could also just filter this on the client side with so little data.
imagine we're fetching a long list of data that needs to be filtered on the server)_

Try removing the eslint-ignore line and giving the effect all its required dependencies.
We're fetching from the API more often -- but that's exactly what we need to do. There's no way around it!
We can't will ourselves into a world where it _doesn't_ depend on its dependencies. We can't lie to React!
